## Project Overview

The project is structured around multiple sheets in an Excel file:

1. **agegroup**: Data about customer age groups and order counts.
2. **Channel**: Data on sales channels and order counts.
3. **GENDER**: Data on the gender of customers and order counts.
4. **AG VS SALES**: Comparison of age groups and sales segmented by gender.
5. **Store Data**: Detailed order information.
6. **Dashboard**: Placeholder for a visual summary of the data (currently empty).

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

1. **Removing Duplicates**: All duplicate values were identified and removed to ensure data accuracy.
2. **Standardizing Gender Values**: The age column had inconsistent values such as "Men", "Women", "M", and "W". These were standardized to "M" and "W" for Men and Women, respectively.
3. **Using Pivot Tables**: Pivot tables were utilized to summarize and analyze the data effectively, enabling the creation of the dashboard.
